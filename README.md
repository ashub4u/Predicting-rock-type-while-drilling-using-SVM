# Predicting-rock-type-while-drilling-using-SVM
I have used the support vector machine (SVM) to classify the rock as medium/rugged strength or soft rock while drilling.
This project aims to quantify the "Measurement while drilling" in a rock. It abruptly enhances the maintenance and operation costs of a drilling operation.
