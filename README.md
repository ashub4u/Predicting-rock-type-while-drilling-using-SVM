# Predicting-rock-type-while-drilling-using-SVM
Here, I have used support vector machine to classify the rock as medium strength rock or soft rock while drilling.
The purpose of this project is to quantify the "Measurement while drilling" in a rock. It abruptly enhances the maintenance and operation cost of a drilling operation.
